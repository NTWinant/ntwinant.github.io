I'm Nathan Winant, and I live in [Austin, TX, USA](http://ht.ly/nlELQ), where
[life](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-07-12/event-horizon/) is generally
[good](https://www.hipstercrite.com/2012/12/05/an-open-letter-to-john-aielli/).

Professionally, I'm a software developer experienced in Java, Linux, full-stack web development, and knowledge-driven applications.
In particular, I've worked with [Semantic Web technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL,
and built [APIs](https://dev.cyc.com/), developer tools, and distributed applications for the [Cyc AI](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cyc).
I've also done a small-but-not-inconsequential amount of voice acting as a robot.
Ask me how to help immanentize the mechapocalypse/eschaton!

In my spare time I'm into
[skepticism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Skepticism#Scientific_and_methodological_skepticism),
getting roped into the occasional overly-elaborate art project,
checking out interesting design and [digital art](https://processing.org/),
and the application of [smoke to food](https://www.texasmonthly.com/topics/barbecue).
