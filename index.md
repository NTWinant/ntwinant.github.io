Howdy! I'm **Nathan Winant**,
a software developer living in [Austin, TX, USA](http://ht.ly/nlELQ), where
[life](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-07-12/event-horizon/) is generally
[good](http://www.hipstercrite.com/2012/12/05/an-open-letter-to-john-aielli/).

By day, I work at [Cycorp](http://www.cyc.com/), where I mainly work on
building knowledge-driven applications and developer tools with Java, HTML5, and Javascript.

My interests include semantic technologies, web technologies,
digital art, the application of smoke to food, candlelit dinners and long walks
on the beach, and running amok in the woods like a crazy person.
