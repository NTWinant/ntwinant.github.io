I'm Nathan Winant; you may know me as some guy on the Internet.
I live in [Austin, TX, USA](http://ht.ly/nlELQ), where
[life](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-07-12/event-horizon/) is generally
[good](http://www.hipstercrite.com/2012/12/05/an-open-letter-to-john-aielli/).

Professionally, I'm a software developer experienced in Java, Linux, full-stack web development, and semantic and knowledge-driven applications. 
I've worked with Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL.
I've built [APIs](http://dev.cyc.com/), developer tools, and distributed applications at [Cycorp](http://www.cyc.com/) for the [Cyc AI](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cyc).
Curiously enough, I've also done a small-but-not-inconsequential amount of voice acting as a robot. 
Ask me how to help immanentize the eschaton and/or mechapocalypse!

In my spare time I'm into
[skepticism](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Skepticism#Scientific_and_methodological_skepticism),
getting roped into the occasional overly-elaborate art project,
checking out interesting design and [digital art](https://processing.org/),
and the application of [smoke to food](http://www.texasmonthly.com/topics/barbecue).
