I'm Nathan Winant; you may know me as a random guy on the Internet.
I live in [Austin, TX, USA](http://ht.ly/nlELQ), where
[life](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-07-12/event-horizon/) is generally
[good](http://www.hipstercrite.com/2012/12/05/an-open-letter-to-john-aielli/).

These days I'm a software developer at [Cycorp](http://www.cyc.com/), where I build semantic
applications and developer tools for the [Cyc AI](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cyc), mainly in
Java, HTML5, and JavaScript. Check out some of our stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/cycorp), and
learn more at the [Cyc Developer Center](http://dev.cyc.com/).

In my spare time I'm into
[skepticism](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Skepticism#Scientific_and_methodological_skepticism),
getting roped into the occasional overly-elaborate art project,
checking out interesting design and [digital art](https://processing.org/),
the application of [smoke to food](http://www.texasmonthly.com/topics/barbecue),
and running amok in the woods like a crazy person.
